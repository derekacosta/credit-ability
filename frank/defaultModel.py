    # it is 0.7 unless user change it
    
# Output:
    # a list. item 0-11 are the default rate for a given month. e.g. the third 
    # one (index 2) is the default rate for the applicant at month 3
    #
    # list[12] is the average amount of money the applicant would have in the bank account
    # list[11] is the probabilty the applicant has a bank account balance below 0. 
    # i.e. real default. This is same as the default rate at the end of month 12
    
# Assumptions: The rent is 30% of the applicant's income and other expenses  
# have the same amount as rent in total. i.e. the applicant will speed 60% of income per month
# By default, the employment rate is 0.7 i.e. the probability for the applicant 
# to get a job with in a month is 0.7
    
# Methodology: Use simulations with randomization to simulate real life possiblities.
# When the applicant ends the contract, the model uses bernoulli trial with 
# p = employment. If the outcome is 1, the applicant gets a new job and to simulate 
# the real lifethe length/contract for the new job is either 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 
# months with the equal probability
